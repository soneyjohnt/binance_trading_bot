# Binance Trading Bot 
This project is an attempt by me to create an automated trading bot that trades in the popular crypto exchange Binance. 

## Goals of the project 
1. The bot should have a general idea about the underlying trend in the market
2. The bot should do a market sentiment analysis in order to determine the trend in the market. 
3. The bot should be able to deploy various different market strategies based on the underlying trend. 
4. The bot should be able to backtest the above mentioned strategies based on the previous data
5. It should have a database of popular crypto coins.
6. It should be able to execute orders in the spot, futures and maybe even options market.
7. It should be able to give me daily updates, and insights on my portfolio and underlying positions.
8. It should have a risk management module.
